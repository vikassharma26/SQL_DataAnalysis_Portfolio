Uber Bus Trip Analysis

Welcome to the "Uber Bus Trip Analysis" repository! In this repository, you will find an in-depth analysis of Uber Bus trips for the month of February 2021. The dataset includes trip details such as client information, driver details, trip status, request details, payment methods, and more.

About the Dataset:

The dataset includes the following columns:
- job_uuid: Unique Identifier for the trip
- client_uuid: Unique Identifier for the rider
- driver_uuid: Unique identifier for the driver
- vehicle_uuid: Unique identifier for the vehicle
- ... (List of other columns)
- trip_date: The date of the trip

Project Highlights:

- MySQL Database Setup:
  - I have created a MySQL database to store the Uber Bus trip data and vehicle information. The SQL statements used for table creation, data population, and database dump are provided in the transcript.

- Python Notebook Analysis:
  - I have created a Jupyter Notebook containing SQL queries to extract insights and generate reports on various business metrics. The notebook includes analyses related to TpR, Reliability, and Demand.

Reports Generated:

  - TpR Analysis:
    - Average trips per rider and distribution of riders in different TpR buckets
    - Distribution of TpR buckets for subscription trips

  - Reliability Analysis:
    - Fulfillment rates and cancellation rates by rider and driver
    - Distribution of fulfillment rate by hour of day and day of week

  - Demand Analysis:
    - Distribution of trips over the duration between request and trip
    - Distribution of trips by hour of day and day of week
    - Distribution of trips by payment method
    - Vehicle utilization distribution by vehicle capacities
    - Walking distance analysis for riders and trips
    - Distribution of trips by distance and duration

How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) to dive into different analysis aspects.
3. Open each Jupyter Notebook to review SQL queries, analyses, and visualizations for specific metrics.

Feel free to interact with the analyses, run the SQL queries, and gain insights from the provided reports. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
